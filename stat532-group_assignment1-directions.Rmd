By the end of the day 11/12/21, please submit a copy of the pdf of the paper your group will be using for the final project to the _project-assignmnet1_ dropbox. Additionally, please submit a single document for your group that addresses the following: 

1. A brief description of the background motivation of your chosen article and a _single_ research question you will choose to investigate that was presented in the paper. Note that your article may address more than 1 questton but I want you to focus on just 1 for this project. 

2. A brief description of the methods used by the authors of your paper to address the question of interest you are focusing on. 

3. The full probability model used in the paper written out in mathematical notation. That is, all likelihood and prior components.
